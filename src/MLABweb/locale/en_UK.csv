"mlab_what_is_text","MLAB is an open-source eletronic building kit for scientists and engineers."
"Modular","Modularity"
"Modular_text","Our kit employs a modular design for simplicity and versatility. We break down complex systems into manageable modules, each containing only the necessary components to function within the larger system. Assembled on a sturdy base of aerial duralumin, these modules facilitate rapid development and enhancement of a wide range of devices."
"Diversity","Diversity"
"Diversity_text","MLAB construction kit contains components made by various manufacturers of sensors, microcontrollers or motor drivers. No specific manufacturer is preferred."
"Open-Source","Open-Source"
"Open-Source_text","MLAB is committed to transparency and collaboration. All of our documentation is publicly available, ensuring that everyone can access, learn from, and build upon our work. This open-source approach fosters an inclusive community of contributors and users."
"Universal","Universality"
"Universal_text","With MLAB, the possibilities are extensive. Our construction kit allows for the building of a broad array of devices and instruments, from straightforward measuring tools to sophisticated devices used in scientific experiments. This versatility makes MLAB a valuable resource across numerous fields of study and application."

"cooper_1","There are always opportunities for improvement and invention. We're constantly seeking enthusiastic individuals to contribute to our development."
"cooper_2_title","Do you have a module you'd like to share?"
"cooper_2","Although MLAB operates on an open-source concept, a new module cannot be added without adhering to our convention. Therefore, it's wise to read up on how to design a good MLAB module.</a>"
"cooper_3_title","Are you interested in contributing but lacking ideas?"
"cooper_3","We have an abundance of ideas and are ready to share them. You can simply choose from our repository on our <a href='http://wiki.mlab.cz/doku.php?id=en:todo'> wiki.</a>"
"cooper_4_title","Unsure about module development?"
"cooper_4","There's no shame in that - don't hesitate to contact us. We'll aim to find a shared objective. The only real mistake would be not to try at all."
